# pwManager

pwManager is a convenient command line password manager. 

A list with services and passwords is kept encrypted on the local system 
and can only be accessed through the program.

You'll see a menu with 5 options:
  1. Show List <-- shows the decrypted list with all services and passwords
  2. Search List <-- search for a service in your list
  3. Add Service <-- add a service and password to your list
  4. Update Service <-- update an existing service in your list
  5. Close <-- will encrypt the list and close the program
